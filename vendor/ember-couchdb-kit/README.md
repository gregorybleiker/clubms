An `ember-data` kit for Apache CouchDB. A collection of adapters to work
with CouchDB documents, attachments, revisions, changes feed.

We love a CouchDB and its RESTful and many other core things such as MVCC, attachments and `/_changes`. These all brings your data and application flow together as well.

Inspired by [pangratz/ember-couchdb-adapter](https://github.com/pangratz/ember-couchdb-adapter) and contains many fixes and newbie features.

There are some of these:

* natural `find/create/deleteRecord` functions;
* ability to work with `views`;
* document's attachements designed as `hasMany` relationship;
* document's revisions designed as `belongsTo` and `hasMany` relationships;
* ability to work with `/_changes` feeds;
